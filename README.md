# peviitor_core

Here is the core of the peviitor project.

Mostly, it's about **data** and the **quality of data**. But it's also about getting the data you are searching for using a full-text indexed search engine.
Workflows, pipelines and code that is validating the rules, keeping the index up-to-date is also part of peviitor_core.

## Technologies

### Search & Indexing Engines

| Technology | Status | Use Case | Notes |
|------------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Apache SOLR** | ✅ Primary | Production indexing, diacritics RO, complex schemas | Job/Company/Auth models, cron integration |
| **OpenSearch** | ✅ Primary | SOLR alternative, AWS compatible | Same schema, managed hosting |
| **Elasticsearch** | ⚠️ Secondary | Legacy compatibility | Existing peviitor scrapers |
| **Typesense** | 🚀 MVP/Prototype | Ultra-fast UI search (<50ms) | Typo-tolerant, developer friendly |

## Notes
- Project is **OPEN SOURCE**.
- Security and procedures related to ways of working will be part of the project.
- How to connect and how to use it will be captured in **documentation**.
- All pull requests will be **documented**.
- peviitor core is not a closed project but an **extensible** one.



## Key Benefits
**Performance, reliability, recovery from disaster, scalability, and validity** are the most valuable benefits this project delivers.

### SOLR/OpenSearch Note

* analyzer: "romanian" preserves diacritics ȘȚĂÂÎ
* search: "Bucuresti" matches "București" automatically

**Purpose**: Remove expired job listings automatically

**Schedule**: Daily @ 02:00 AM EET
**Logic**: 
- DELETE jobs WHERE `expirationdate` < NOW() AND `validation`="verified"
- SOLR/OpenSearch: `delete_by_query` range query on `expirationdate`

**Purpose**: Validate job URLs are still active **DAILY**

**Schedule**: Daily @ 06:00 AM EET  
**Workflow**:
1. SELECT jobs WHERE `validation`="verified" AND `date` > 1 day ago
2. Parallel HTTP HEAD requests (max 1000 concurrent) to `job_link`
3. **404** → DELETE job immediately
4. **200 OK** → Parse content for "expirat"/"ocupat"/"închis"/"no longer available"/"filled"
5. **Invalid content** → SET `validation`="tested", schedule recheck in 24h
6. **Valid** → UPDATE `validation`="verified", `vdate`=NOW()
**Max batch**: 50k jobs/day, prioritize newest first


## Plugins

The following components are considered **plugins** for the peviitor core project:

- BFF API — Backend-for-Frontend API layers that tailor data and endpoints for different clients.
- UI — Web or mobile user interfaces and frontend components.
- Scrapers — Automated data collectors that fetch and normalize job and company data.
- Manual data validator — Tools or interfaces used by humans to validate and correct data.
- Integrations — Connectors to external services (analytics, exporters, auth providers, etc.).
